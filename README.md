## 💡 Recommendation for CoStar

**Use Bed/Bath Configuration Analysis** to expand valuation models. The data shows a sharp pricing increase among rare high-bedroom, high-bathroom layouts (e.g., 10/11, 8/9) which can be targeted for premium investment and luxury development.  

Additionally, cities like Hewlett Bay Park consistently outperform others — highlighting them as key markets for focused attention in comparative pricing tools.

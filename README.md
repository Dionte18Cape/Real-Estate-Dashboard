## 📌 Business Problem

> How can real estate professionals identify the most valuable regions and home layouts to target high-priced market segments?

---

## ✅ Key Recommendations

- 🏙️ **Focus on coastal luxury zones:** Cities like Hewlett Bay Park drive average prices up due to exclusive layouts and limited supply.
- 🛏️ **Prioritize complex layouts:** Listings with higher bed/bath counts (e.g., 10 bed / 11 bath) command the highest price per Sq Ft.
- 🏗️ **Builders should model after high-$/sqft layouts** in top regions to maximize ROI.
- 📍 **Use interactive filters (State, Bedrooms)** to drill into specific market opportunities per region.
